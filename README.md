# a*Me*liorate
(This app is in Progress)


## Project Proposal
a*Me*liorate is an app for those who want to optimize their lives. Track certain statistics over time and see how they influence you using intuitive visualization tools. 

As a general example, notice that on Monday you had 6 cups of water and pasta for lunch and dinner which made you feel bad on Tuesday. Whereas on Thursday you exercised, had 12 cups of water, and had plenty healthy foods, and as a result felt great on Friday.
